📜 Purpose: The Living Growth of the Suquelish language "Suquelinese"
This directory serves as the fertile ground for the evolution of the Suquelish Language. While the Core Foundations established by Jeffrey David Mason and Founding Father Marc Mason remain immutable, this space is reserved for the community to expand the linguistic horizon of the Suquelish Republic for centuries to come.
