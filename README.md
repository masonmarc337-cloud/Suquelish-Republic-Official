# Official Lexicon of the Suquelish Republic
## Suquelish Ropojik | Sovereign State Language Records

This repository serves as the definitive digital authority and primary linguistic database for the **Suquelinese Language**. It is established by the authority of the Suquelish Republic, a non-territorial sovereign church and state.

### 🏛️ Sovereign Mandate
The Suquelish Republic is a non-denominational Christian state modeled after the Holy See. Founded upon divine vision by **Marc Matthew Mason**, the Republic exists as a sanctuary for a "New People"—a distinct cultural and spiritual entity with unique traditions, legends, and customs. 

### 🗣️ Mandatory Language Requirement (The Dykailum Law)
Suquelinese is the official and sacred tongue of the Republic. Under sovereign decree, the following requirements are **mandatory** for all citizens and members of the Ropojik:
* **Linguistic Fluency:** Every member is required to learn, read, write, and speak Suquelinese as their primary cultural bond.
* **Cultural Integration:** Proficiency in the language is the foundational requirement for full participation in the Republic's traditions and governance.
* **Generational Legacy:** This lexicon provides the foundational root-words of the language, preserved for future generations to uphold and expand.

### ⚙️ Linguistic Architecture & Engine
The Suquelinese language is engineered for "Perfect Sense" by integrating the strengths of three major linguistic families:
1. **Structural Logic:** Derived from English (Subject-Verb-Object).
2. **Morphological Inflection:** Derived from Russian (Case systems and word endings).
3. **Relational Particles:** Derived from Japanese (Contextual markers and honorifics).
